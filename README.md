The frontend of the application lives in the [`/publisher`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/justice-counts/tree/main/publisher) directory of this repo. The backend of the application lives in the [`recidiviz-data`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/recidiviz-data) Github repo in the [`justice_counts/control_panel`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/recidiviz-data/tree/main/recidiviz/justice_counts/control_panel) directory.
- **Technical Specification** [TBD]
