# Justice Counts

This repository contains technical infrastructure for the Justice Counts initiative. This consists of the following components:

- **Publisher**: a tool that allows agencies to report Justice Counts metrics. The frontend of the application lives in the [`/publisher`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/justice-counts/tree/main/publisher) directory of this repo. The backend of the application lives in the [`recidiviz-data`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/recidiviz-data) Github repo in the [`justice_counts/control_panel`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/recidiviz-data/tree/main/recidiviz/justice_counts/control_panel) directory, which is a separate repo from this one.
- **Agency Dashboards**: a tool to view and download published Justice Counts data as well as generate insights. The frontend of the application lives in the [`/agency-dashboard`](https://github.com/Recidiviz/justice-counts/tree/main/agency-dashboard) directory of this repo.
