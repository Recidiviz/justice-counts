# Justice Counts Agency Dashboard: Frontend

Welcome to the Justice Counts Agency Dashboard - a tool to view and download published Justice Counts data as well as generate insights.

The frontend of this application, which lives in this directory, was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs). There is currently no backend hooked into this app yet. That's TBD!
