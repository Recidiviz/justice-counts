This file is created for documenting ui components that can be made as shared and used throughout the publisher application

1.
- Button Component
- Generally speaking, I think that there is no need to write where Button is used (originally located in DataUpload.styles)
because this component (I mean action button not radio button like in metric config or create record) can be modified in a way
that it will be fully customizable. If there will be any specific cases with buttons that are in conflict with Button
shared component settings then in styles file we can always create specific button and use shared one as a base.

2.
- Tabbed bar
- Used in: Records page, Settings -> Metric config, Data entry (note: in data entry it is slightly different,
has indicator and more options, so it is to be investigated if data entry tabs can be in this list)

3.
- Overlapping header (DataUploadHeader)
- Used in UploadFile, Data Entry, Review metrics

4.
- Table
- Used in Records and UploadedFiles (they have different columns disappear when responsive, can adjust columns or something like that)

5.
- Dropdowns
- Used in responsive views mostly (records, metric config, data page, etc.)
I know that Dropdown is already from recidiviz/design-system, but we can make a customizable dropdown on top of it and reuse it

6.
- Confirmation/Success Modals
- Used in agency settings, team management, now in review
Might be a problem cause they all do not use icon, also probably by design they had different dimensions,
but I guess we can make a fixed version which will be customizable like review page where you pass all props like text, icons, buttons etc.
